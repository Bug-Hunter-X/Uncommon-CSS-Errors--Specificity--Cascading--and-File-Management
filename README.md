# Uncommon CSS Errors and Solutions

This repository demonstrates common yet often overlooked issues in CSS, specifically focusing on specificity conflicts, the cascading nature of styles, and file management.  The `bug.css` file contains problematic code illustrating these issues, while `bugSolution.css` provides corrected and improved implementations.

The core problems addressed include:

* **Specificity Conflicts:**  Incorrectly handling CSS specificity, leading to styles not applying as expected.
* **Cascading Issues:**  Unexpected style overrides due to the order of CSS declarations or files.
* **Missing Styles:**  Styles failing to render due to missing or incorrectly linked CSS files.

Understanding and resolving these issues is crucial for writing robust and maintainable CSS code.
