The CSS specificity rules can lead to unexpected results if not carefully managed. For instance, if you have conflicting styles defined with different selectors, the most specific selector will win, even if it's not what you intended. This often involves using `!important`, which while effective, makes debugging and maintaining the code challenging. Another common issue involves the cascading nature of CSS; styles defined earlier in the document can sometimes unexpectedly override later styles. Also, the order of your CSS files can impact the final style output, and forgetting to include necessary files leads to missing styles completely.
